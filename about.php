                    Founded in 2016 by Rev Father Herbert Niba, Priest of the diocese of Buea (Cameroon), My Daily Song is a non-profit studio record that produces daily meditations voice notes. All meditations are done over some gospel music.
                    Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent. We believe it ultimately points us to Jesus, who has the power to change individuals and whole communities when we let the biblical story speak for itself.
                    We focus on the Bible's overarching themes and the message brought forth by each gospel music and are committed to bringing God’s people closer to God.
